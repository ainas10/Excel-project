## Analyzing financial data and creating a dashboard using Excel
OBJECTIVE:
1. To create a summary dashboard with the key performance indicators, i.e., Total loan applications, Total funded amount, Total amount received, Average interest rate, Average debt-to-income ratio
2. To create an overview dashboard that provides a view of the charts, i.e., Monthly trends based on date, Regional analysis based on state, Long term analysis in the form of donut chart, Employee length analysis in the form of bar charts, Purpose of loan as bar charts and Home Ownership Analysis as a tree map along with the respective metrics.
3. A third dashboard key to show the detailed data of the loan, i.e., the data sheet
    
DESCRIPTION:
In this project, I first obtained the financial data of a bank who sent out loans to people living in different states for different purposes. I uploaded the data on excel and first created pivot tables to meet the requirements of the dashboard. I then inserted the desired types of chart onto the design sheet. Then using shapes and other tools in Excel I creater the summary dashboard and the overview dashboard and formatted the charts and fonts to make the dashboard look presentable.
